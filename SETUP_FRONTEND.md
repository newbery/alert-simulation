# Frontend for Alert Simulation App

This is a React app built with Typescript.


## Quickstart (production mode)

For convenience, the latest 'build' has already been committed to this repo
so, unless you're doing frontend development, you can skip the rest of this
and go straight to SETUP_BACKEND.md for instructions on how to set up and
run the backend server which automatically serves the latest frontend 'build'.


## Development mode

Move into the 'frontend' directory.

`cd frontend`

Install requirements:

`npm install`

Launch the app:

`npm start`

This runs the application in "development mode".
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You can open the app manually in multiple web browser windows but the behavior
in that case will likely be unpredictable as multiple sessions are not supported.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
